Neural Style Transfer using pretrained VGG19

This code uses a pretrained VGG19 network which has been trianed on the ImageNet data (very large dataset) to learn low and high level features.

The inputs are the content image and style image which are appropriately sized. The code outputs the content image styled using features learnt from the style image.
